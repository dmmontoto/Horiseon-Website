# Take a look at Horiseon's new starting page for their website. 

[Horiseon Website](https://dmmontoto.github.io/Horiseon-Website/)

My initial priority was following HTML semantics. The original HTML provided by Horiseon had a lack of proper HTML brackets. The majority of their HTML page consisted of many dull 'div' sections. While 'div' is a good semantic when used properly, the File clearly used 'div' too much. By adding various semantics such as 'section', 'nav', 'aside', and others, I was able to make the file easier to comprehend, for fellow developers.

Short and concise CSS files are important, especially when projects contains multiple and copious lines of code. To be more precise, many changes had to be made in the CSS file. Multiple classes were combined into one if identical elements were shared, like font size and color. This simple, yet effective move, can help fellow developers navigate the CSS file and ensure ideal changes are made where there need to be. 

Below, a simple screenshot of Horiseon's website is provided to give the viewer a preview of their site.
